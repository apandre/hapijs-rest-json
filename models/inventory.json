    "description": "This course introduces popular approaches to user password protection and storage, analyzing their common weaknesses and those properties that help schemes resist attack.\nBy learning to evaluate password storage schemes through the properties of their building blocks (hashes, salts, and algorithms), you will be able to properly evaluate password storage options in your development framework, and to articulate the trade-o s between modern schemes. At course end, you will be able to select and harden through con guration your application’s password storage scheme, or select a suitable replacement that best meets your application’s needs.",
